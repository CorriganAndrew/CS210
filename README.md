I created the Corner Grocer Tracking Program to make it easier for a store to keep track of how often each item is purchased, using a straightforward menu system. The program reads a list of items from a text file, counts how many times each one appears, and then lets users see these counts in different ways—by searching for a single item, viewing all items together, or even looking at a simple text-based chart. I organized everything into a GroceryTracker class so the main file wouldn’t get cluttered, which also makes it simpler to maintain and extend in the future. If I had more time, I’d enhance it by handling item searches without worrying about capitalization, adding stronger input checks, and possibly letting users sort items alphabetically or by how often they’re bought. Getting the file reading and histogram display just right was a bit tricky, but I used print statements and online resources to troubleshoot and verify each step. I’m glad I learned so much about object-oriented coding, file handling, and keeping things clearly named and well-structured—it’s going to help a lot with other projects, since writing maintainable, readable, and adaptable code is useful in almost any software development scenario.
